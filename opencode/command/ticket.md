## Ticket Creation

Create a Linear ticket for: **$ARGUMENTS**

### Process

1. **Clarify the Work**
   - What needs to be done?
   - Why does it matter?
   - What's the acceptance criteria?

2. **Gather Context**
   - Related tickets or projects?
   - Technical constraints?
   - Dependencies?

3. **Write the Ticket**
   - Clear, action-oriented title
   - Description with context
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Technical notes if relevant

4. **Create in Linear**
   - Select team
   - Add labels
   - Set priority if known
   - Link to project if applicable

### Ticket Template

```markdown
## Context
[Why this work matters, background]

## Requirements
- [ ] Requirement 1
- [ ] Requirement 2

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criteria 1
- [ ] Criteria 2

## Technical Notes
[Optional: implementation hints, constraints]

## Related
- Depends on: [ticket IDs]
- Related to: [ticket IDs]
- Spec: [Confluence link]
```

### Output

- Linear ticket URL
- Ticket ID for reference

### Quick Mode

For simple tickets, just provide:
- Title
- One-line description
- Team

And I'll create it quickly without the full template.
