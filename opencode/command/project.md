## Project Creation

Create a Linear project for: **$ARGUMENTS**

### Process

1. **Understand Scope**
   - What's the overall goal?
   - What are the major milestones?
   - Who's involved?

2. **Design Project Structure**
   - Project name and description
   - Milestones or phases
   - Timeline estimates (if known)

3. **Break Down into Tickets**
   For each work item:
   - Clear, action-oriented title
   - Context and requirements
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Dependencies on other tickets
   - Estimate (if known)

4. **Create in Linear**
   - Create project
   - Create tickets linked to project
   - Set up dependencies
   - Add labels

### Ticket Sizing Guidelines

- **Small** (1-2 hours): Config changes, small bug fixes
- **Medium** (half day - 1 day): Single feature, contained scope
- **Large** (2-3 days): Complex feature, multiple components
- **Too Big** (> 3 days): Break it down further

### Output

- Linear project URL
- List of created tickets with IDs
- Summary of structure

### Reference Materials

If there's an existing PRD or spec:
- Link it in the project description
- Reference it in relevant tickets
