Explain how this code works: $ARGUMENTS

1. Find and read the relevant code
2. Trace the execution flow
3. Explain in plain language:
   - What it does (purpose)
   - How it works (mechanism)
   - Key functions/classes involved
   - Data flow
   - Any gotchas or edge cases

Use simple language. Include code snippets to illustrate points.

If explaining a complex system, consider creating a diagram (ASCII or describe visually).
