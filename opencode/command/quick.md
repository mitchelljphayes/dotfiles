**Skip workflows and implement directly**: $ARGUMENTS

Do not:
- Create session directories
- Delegate to subagents
- Run full research/plan/build/review cycles
- Ask for checkpoints

Just:
1. Understand what's needed
2. Read relevant files
3. Make the changes
4. Briefly summarize what you did

This is for small, straightforward tasks where the full workflow is overkill.
