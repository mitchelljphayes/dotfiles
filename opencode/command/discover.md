## Feature Discovery

Research and discover: **$ARGUMENTS**

### What This Does

Discovery is about understanding the landscape before committing to a solution:

1. **Problem Research**
   - What's the actual user pain?
   - How big is the problem?
   - Who's affected?

2. **Solution Research**
   - How do others solve this?
   - What patterns exist?
   - What's already in our codebase?

3. **Feasibility Assessment**
   - Technical complexity
   - Dependencies and risks
   - Rough effort estimate

4. **Recommendation**
   - Should we build this?
   - What approach makes sense?
   - What's the MVP?

### Research Methods

I'll use:
- Web research for industry patterns
- Codebase exploration for existing solutions
- Linear/Confluence search for prior discussions

### Output

Discovery document with:
- Problem summary
- Research findings
- Options considered
- Recommendation
- Next steps

Save to `.opencode/sessions/<task>/discovery.md`

### Next Steps After Discovery

- Proceed to PRD (`/prd`)
- Create tickets for spike/prototype
- Decide not to pursue (and document why)
- Need more information (and what)
