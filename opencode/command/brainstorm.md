## Brainstorming Session

Let's explore: **$ARGUMENTS**

### My Role

I'll help you think through this by:
- Asking clarifying questions
- Offering different perspectives
- Identifying edge cases
- Suggesting approaches
- Playing devil's advocate when useful

### How This Works

This is conversational and exploratory. No pressure to reach conclusions.

I might ask:
- What problem are we really solving?
- Who experiences this pain?
- What does success look like?
- What have you already tried or considered?
- What constraints do we have?
- What's the simplest version of this?

### Capturing Ideas

As we talk, I'll keep track of:
- Key insights
- Decisions made
- Open questions
- Next steps

### Output Options

When we're done exploring:
- Summary of discussion
- Draft requirements to refine
- Ready to write a PRD (`/prd`)
- Create tickets directly (`/ticket`)

### Let's Start

What's on your mind about this? What's the core problem or opportunity you're seeing?
