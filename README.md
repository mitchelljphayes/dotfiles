# dotfiles

This is the current iteration of my dotfiles. 

I'm working to make it cross platform, but we're a long way off.

Most of the shell stuff came from https://github.com/anishathalye/dotfiles and I'm currently using dotbot (also by anish) to manage them. 

The neovim config was written by following this neovim from scratch tutorial. https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhoH5vyxr6Qq41NFL4GvhFp-WLd5xzIzZ
